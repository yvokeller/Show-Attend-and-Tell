The Decoder uses the extracted image features to initialize the states of the LSTM cell (by averaging them) and then employs an **attention mechanism** at each time step to focus on different parts of the image while generating the caption. The Decoder predicts one word of the caption at each time step, and its prediction is conditioned on the current LSTM state, the context vector from the attention mechanism, and the previous word. Teacher forcing, a common technique in training sequence generation models where the ground truth word is fed as the next input instead of the model's prediction, is optionally used.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - **Concept**: The soft attention mechanism is deterministic because it doesn't involve random sampling. Instead, it uses a predictable, continuous function (the weighted sum) to determine the focus.\n",
    "  - **Significance**: This deterministic nature makes the entire model, including the attention mechanism, smooth and differentiable, allowing for standard backpropagation during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Normalized Weighted Geometric Mean (NWGM)\n",
    "$$ N W G M\\left[p\\left(y_t=k \\mid \\mathbf{a}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbb{E}_{p\\left(s_t \\mid a\\right)}\\left[n_{t, k}\\right]\\right)}{\\sum_j \\exp \\left(\\mathbb{E}_{p\\left(s_t \\mid a\\right)}\\left[n_{t, j}\\right]\\right)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: NWGM is used for calculating the probability of the next word in the caption. It approximates the softmax probability distribution over possible next words by applying softmax to the expectations of the underlying linear projections.\n",
    "- **Significance**: This approach aligns with the standard mechanism for generating predictions in neural networks, facilitating efficient training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Simplification for Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Learning with deterministic soft attention is more straightforward than with stochastic hard attention. The expected context vector can be directly used in forward propagation, and standard backpropagation can be applied for training.\n",
    "- **Significance**: This simplification means that models with soft attention can be trained efficiently with conventional optimization algorithms, making them practical for large-scale applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Approximation to Marginal Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept**: Deterministic soft attention can be seen as an approximation to optimizing the marginal likelihood over attention locations, which is a complex problem in the stochastic hard attention setting.\n",
    "- **Significance**: It provides a practical and computationally efficient way to capture the benefits of attention mechanisms without the need for complex sampling or optimization methods required by stochastic hard attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic Soft Attention offers a practical and efficient method for implementing attention mechanisms in neural networks, especially for tasks like image captioning. By calculating a weighted sum of input features and avoiding the complexity of stochastic sampling, it facilitates smooth and differentiable models that are amenable to standard training techniques. This approach enables the model to effectively focus on relevant parts of the input while maintaining computational tractability and ease of training."

    "### Implementation of the Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough theory, let's apply this knowledge to the code. The attention mechanism is implemented as a separate module used by the decoder at each time step. I use the deterministic soft attention mechanism described above because implementing stochastic hard attention is dramatically more complex and would require reinforcement learning to train the model, which is beyond the scope of the deep learning course for which I am implementing this project. It is worth noting, however, that Stochastic Hard Attention performed slightly better than Deterministic Soft Attention in the original paper, as measured by the BLEU score.\n",
